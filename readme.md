*Glue between eros and inspector*

<img src="./demo.png" alt="demo image" title="Modus Vivendi & Iosevka btw">

This package provides glue between the popular elisp development packages [eros](https://github.com/xiongtx/eros) and [inspector](https://github.com/mmontone/emacs-inspector). \
No longer do you have to choose between an evaluation overlay and a nice representation of evaluation results.

`eros-inspector-eval-last-sexp` combines `eros-eval-last-sexp` and `inspector-inspect-last-sexp` \
`eros-inspector-eval-defun` combines `eros-eval-defun` and `inspector-inspect-defun`
